# ü§ñ Simple Codebot

![Chatbot Demo](image.png)

## üõ†Ô∏è Description
This project features a basic chatbot implemented in Python using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The chatbot engages in a text-based conversation with the user through a simple GUI. Although there might be a slight delay during the initial load due to the model being loaded into memory, once loaded, the chatbot is quite responsive and provides a delightful text-generation based interaction. The language model Microsoft-Phi-1 is a Transformer with 1.3 billion parameters, specialized for basic Python coding.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face Transformers:** [This project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1) for text generation.
